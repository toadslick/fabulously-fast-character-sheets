<h1>Fabulously Fast <strong>Character Sheets</strong></h1>

<p>Years of running tabletop RPGs has taught us that games flow the smoothest when players have all the information they need right in front of them.</p>
<h2>Our goals</h2>
<div id="goals">
<ul>
<li>to create and level up player characters</li>
<li>to create NPCs on the fly as quickly as possible</li>
<li>and to play full sessions of Fabula Ultima</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>...using only the printed materials in front of us. No screens, no books, and the portability to play anywhere from a bar booth to a campsite. So we made these tools for our own campaigns.</p>
<p>By the time we were done, we thought they were worth sharing with the rest of the world.</p>
<h2>The result</h2>
<div class="result" id="classes">
<p><strong>Every official character class, fully represented on a single printed page.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>This includes all classes from the Core Rulebook, the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/445259/fabula-ultima-atlas-high-fantasy">High Fantasy Atlas</a>, the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/514616/fabula-ultima-atlas-natural-fantasy">Natural Fantasy Atlas</a>, the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/481039/fabula-ultima-atlas-techno-fantasy">Techno Fantasy Atlas</a>, and the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/553256/fabula-ultima-ttjrpg-bonus-collection">Bonus Content</a>. Gone are the days of copying the full text of a spell or class skill!</p>
<p>Classes from the core rulebook also come with playtest versions that include all the changes to their spells and skills from the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/46567344">official playtest materials</a>.</p>
<div class="result" id="npc">
<p><strong>A step-by-step checklist and single-page character sheet for quickly creating NPCs.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="result" id="guide">
<p><strong>All of the core gameplay mechanics summarized on two sides of a single printed page.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="rules">
<ul>
<li>checks</li>
<li>clocks</li>
<li>conflict actions</li>
<li>opportunities</li>
<li>travel</li>
<li>Fabula points</li>
<li>inventory points</li>
<li>rituals</li>
<li>projects</li>
<li>resting</li>
<li>camp activities</li>
<li>experience</li>
<li>leveling up</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="result" id="inventory">
<p><strong>The full inventory of basic items and services, including custom weapons and Qualities, on a single page.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="result" id="cards">
<p><strong>Cards for quickly conveying all the information that players need to know about the current conflict.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Cards display the current clocks, participating characters, affinities, status effects, who is flying or in crisis, and who has acted in the current combat round. We recommend laminating them to use with a dry erase marker!</p>
<p>Together, these tools have kept our games of Fabula Ultima moving quickly and have kept players engaged in the action and story. We hope you'll find them as useful and convenient as we do.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>What makes these character sheets faster to use?</h3>
<p>The official character sheets for Fabula Ultima require you to copy all of the text of your class skills and spells into your character sheet. This ends up being a lot, especially for skills such as Magichants, Gadgets, Magiseeds, Invocations, Arcana, or Personal Vehicle.</p>
<p>With these sheets, simply fill in the circles next to the skills or spells that your character has taken. Every class sheet includes all of the options available to that class, the unique rules that are specific to the class, and fields for remembering the state of your character. For example, the Elementalist class sheet includes every Elementalist spell, the Esper class includes every Psychic Gift as well as a Brainwave Clock, and the Tinkerer's sheet includes every Gadget, along with fields for your Magisphere prototypes and the properties of your current Magicannon.</p>
<h3>The Fabula Ultima skill and spell descriptions are very precise in their wording. What did you change to fit each class on its own page?</h3>
<p>When space allowed we kept the full text of skills and spells, with these exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>when a skill or spell requires you to make a choice, we formatted that as a bulleted list instead of a long sentence of commas and semicolons in order to improve readability.</li>
<li>we removed references to other books or pages, such as &quot;(see below)&quot; or &quot;(see page 123 of the High Fantasy Atlas)&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>As space constraints required, we also made the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>we excluded sentences that were only about roleplaying a class and not about its mechanical rules.</li>
<li>we used abbreviations to replace frequently repeated text, such as &quot;BC&quot; to replace &quot;the number of filled segments of your Brainwave Clock&quot; for Esper gifts or &quot;SL&quot; to replace &quot;your skill level in Chloromancy&quot; for Floralist magiseeds. In such cases, text was included to explain the abbreviation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike the class sheets, the Player's Guide, Inventory, and NPC Creation Guide are heavily abbreviated, reworded, and reformatted in order to include as much information in as clear and concise a format as possible. When in doubt or in need of clarity, please check the Fabula Ultima official rulebooks, which these documents are not intended to replace.</p>
<h3>Do you have versions of the rule summaries without playtest changes?</h3>
<p>Not at this time. We think the playtest changes to the core rules are entirely positive, and encourage others to adopt them!</p>
<h3>What should I do if I've found a mistake in your materials?</h3>
<p>We're happy to fix any errors we've made. After all, we use these documents in our own games! Please <a href="#TODO">submit a bug report</a> with the details and let us know if you'd like to be credited in the changelog for reporting the error.</p>
